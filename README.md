# Windows10OSDScripts

Scripts found in this repo are used for helping Operating System Deployment tasks for Windows 10.

Windows 10 Start Menu Configuration helps create a standard start menu layout including pinning items to task bars and creating start menu groups. This script also creates an additional script that gets called once when a new user profile is created to help unlock the Windows 10 Taskbar Items so users can remove the defaults when they want.
